# Data

The dataset we use can be found [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv).

We clean the data by turning categorical variables into dummies, mean centering and standardizing.

We have 400 entries in total and use 3:1 ratio for train-test-split, which gets us a training set with 300 entries and test set with 100 entries.
